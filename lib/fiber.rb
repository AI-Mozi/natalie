# This is a stub file to help the specs that have `require "fiber"` in them. This makes it possible to remove all
# the work arounds we have in our specs folder, and helps with displaying the actual status on the page
# <https://natalie-lang.org/specs>.
# Starting with Ruby 3.1, this file is no longer required and does not do anything on MRI. As soon as the Ruby
# Specs drop support for Ruby 3.0, we can remove this file again.
